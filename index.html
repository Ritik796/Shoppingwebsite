                Home mail delivery systems and modern technology (such as television, telephones, and the Internet), in
                combination with electronic commerce, allow consumers to shop from home. There are three main types of
                home shopping: mail or telephone ordering from catalogs; telephone ordering in response to
                advertisements in print and electronic media (such as periodicals, TV and radio); and online shopping.
                Online shopping has completely redefined the way people make their buying decisions; the Internet
                provides access to a lot of information about a particular product, which can be looked at, evaluated,
                and comparison-priced at any given time. Online shopping allows the buyer to save the time and expense,
                which would have been spent traveling to the store or mall. According to technology and research firm
                Forrester, mobile purchases or mcommerce will account for 49% of ecommerce, or $252 billion in sales, by
                2020

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Convenience stores are common in North America, and are often called "bodegas" in Spanish-speaking
                communities or "dépanneurs" in French-speaking ones. Sometimes peddlers and ice cream trucks pass
                through neighborhoods offering goods and services. Also, garage sales are a common form of second hand
                resale.

                Neighbourhood shopping areas and retailers give value to a community by providing various social and
                community services (like a library), and a social place to meet. Neighbourhood retailing differs from
                other types of retailers such as destination retailers because of the difference in offered products and
                services, location and popularity. Neighbourhood retailers include stores such as; Food shops/marts,
                dairies, Pharmacies, Dry cleaners, Hairdressers/barbers, Bottle shops, Cafés and take-away shops .
                Destination retailers include stores such as; Gift shops, Antique shops, Pet groomers, Engravers, Tattoo
                parlour, Bicycle shops, Herbal dispensary clinics, Art galleries, Office Supplies and framers.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                "Window shopping" is a term referring to the browsing of goods by a consumer with or without the intent
                to purchase. Window shopping is often practised by a particular segment, known as the
                recreation-conscious or hedonistic shopper. Recreational shopping is characterised by the consumer's
                engagement in the purchase process, and recreational shoppers are those consumers who see the act of
                shopping as a form of enjoyment. Other consumers use window shopping as part of their planning
                activity for a later purchase.

                Showrooming, the practice of examining merchandise in a traditional retail store without purchasing it,
                but then shopping online to find a lower price for the same item, has become an increasingly prevalent
                problem for traditional retailers as a result of online competitors, so much so that some have begun to
                take measures to combat it.
